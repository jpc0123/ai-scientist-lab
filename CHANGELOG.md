# Changelog

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-22

Offline LLM provider architecture and evaluation.

### Added
- Unified `LLMProvider` layer: Fake, Replay, audit records, JSON Schema validation
- `ProviderPlanner` / `ProviderCritic` adapters (`mock` | `fake` | `replay`)
- Quality evaluation (`llm-eval`) comparing Mock / Fake / Replay (Real deferred)
- Token / cost / latency limits (`LimitingProvider`) and usage summary (`llm-usage`)
- Finite tree expansion via `tree-plan-next --provider`
- Acceptance: `scripts/accept_v13.py`, `docs/acceptance/v1.3/`

### Notes
- Default planner/critic path remains **mock**
- No real cloud LLM calls in this release
- After `v1.3.0`, only bugfixes land on this line; new work goes to v1.4+
